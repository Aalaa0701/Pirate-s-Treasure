## Pirate's Traesure
it is a game made by unity engine for the project of the season in Support asu game committee.
this game was a great chance for me to apply all what i have learned in terms of:
-Movement basics.
-Melee attacks
-Ranged attacks
-Coroutines
-Enemies that follow the player in attempt to kill him.
-UI
-Lighting.
